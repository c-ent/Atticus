                        I found myself once again wondering and pondering the questions and mysteries of the universe. Its complex divinity brought upon the wildest turbulence that rummages my mind. I found myself once more looking for the uncertainties and settle with what's beyond my understanding.

                        I posed and pondered, "The waters across the shore pulls its waves back and forth signifying the ocean's indecisiveness. The trees found itself swaying from the challenges upon its firmness amidst the commands of the breath of the wind. Stones remain unturned from the deepest conviction of indifference."

                        I cleared my mind from the foggy shadows that envelopes and inhibits to resume its wonders and wander. I began to say, "Do not go gentle into that good night and open your eyes and find the light. I shall seek the brightest star in the benign night and I must seek my home into the wuthering height."
